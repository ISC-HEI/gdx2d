/**
 * A class to play <em>short</em> samples within gdx2d. The music sample
 * must be short because it is completely loaded into memory. The counterpart
 * is that you can play many many samples at the same time and modify their pitch
 * and volume dynamically (see {@link #setPitch(float)} and {@link #setVolume(float)}).
 * 
 * Note that {@link SoundSample} differs from {@link MusicPlayer}
 * in the sense that a sample is completely loaded into memory before 
 * playing. Thus, it makes sense to play short samples but not complete
 * songs (for background music for instance).
