# Official gdx2d website

This is the source code of the [hevs-isi/gdx2d](https://github.com/hevs-isi/gdx2d) website available online at https://hevs-isi.github.io/gdx2d/.

The code source of the gdx2d project is available in the [hevs-isi/gdx2d](https://github.com/hevs-isi/gdx2d) repository.

## Jekyll

This website is based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Before getting started, you'll need to install:

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
2. [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

Then, run the following command to install Jekyll and the required gems using Bundler:

```sh
$ ./script/install.sh
```

Or install the required gems manually (use `github-pages versions` to list the dependency versions):

```sh
$ gem update
$ gem install github-pages
```

Finally, run the `./script/server.sh` script from the root folder to build and serve Jekyll locally. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/gdx2d/](http://localhost:4000/gdx2d/) to see the website.
